Hey team, I’m so happy, I have first user feedbacks, from my best friend who is a great gamer. Please look at it and give a plan to upgrade CrazyGameLite to the next level!

* Bugs:
    - Score should be at 0 by default, not 5. Still increase by 1 for each food.
    - Score display is on top of the canevas, this remove some visibility of the game play, the score must be placed outside the canevas.

* Improvements:
 
    - Unify fonts and use Jersey_20 font for all texts in the game.
    - All frames and botton have sharp corner, no more rounded corners.
    - No more fade or glow effect in the graphic design guidelines.
    - Display on top of the canevas, the current score on the left (left-aligned) and the top score on the right (right-aligned). Use 2 colors, one for current score, a second for top score.
        -   Like this: Score: XXXX     Top score: XXXXX
    - Difficult to see the various food shapes, better to visualise all foods as a square, like the growing food. Keep food colours consistent with the effect on snake (invincibility, wall phase, speed increase, speed decrease, reverse controls).
    - Snake head is not enough visible, please add with 2 white eyes will be better. I can provide an image reference. And the border color for the snake should be the same as the grid background color.
    - Users are lost with the way to remove the phone call screen, please add text “Presse space bar or click on End” for the phone call screen.
    - Snake death need a accoustic signal with a dedicated sound to play when the snake die. We should add that.
    - Title should be "Crazy Snake" instead of "CrazySankeLite".
    - Current names for phone calls are not hilarous, please remove then and replace it by:
    The Tech Puns (Puns on hardware and software). These sound like real names at first glance, but they are pure geekery:

        GAME OVER



* TBD
    - Change the walls color to dark grey. RGB value 25,25,25.
    - NOT SURE - Difficult to play on mobile without a proper keyboard like on dekstop. Maybe we can think about adding a simple visual keyboard with only 4 arrows (left, right, up, down) for tactile action on touchscreen.
   - New color scheme for the game:
        - Color Name: "Tech Red", Hex: #ff0004, for speed increase food
        - Color Name: "Patriarch", Hex: #7A0080, for wall phase food
        - Color Name: "Digital Yellow", Hex: #FFFF00, for invincibility food (blinking with Deep black color)
        - Color Name: "Lime Green", Hex: #30C030, for growing food
        - Color Name: "Psychedelic" Blue, Hex: #002CFF, for speed decrease food
        - Color Name: "Orange", Hex: #FF7E00, for reverse control food
        - Color Name: "Deep black", Hex: #000000, for defaul snake color
